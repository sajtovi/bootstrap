		Dimitrije Mirić was born in January 1957, into a family of ethnic Serbs (Bosnian Serbs) in the village of Bogutovo Selo near the town of Ugljevik in the northeastern part of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia (modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). He finished secondary school in Ugljevik. He began his professional career in 1975 with the release of his first single, Od mene je ljubav jaca, on newly established Diskoton, based in Sarajevo, followed by another single, Kad se spusti tiho vece, on national record label PGP-RTB, based in capital Belgrade, in Serbia. In 1976 he moved to Serbia, and joined recording house Diskos based in Aleksandrovac. Diskos was among the major record labels of former Yugoslavia. He began singing in a Sremska Mitrovica restaurant. An important part in his success and career was Novica Urošević, who had written for Mitar from 1979 until 1997. Another important part was Branimir Đokić's orchestra which accompanied Mirić from 1979 to 1984, with whom he recorded four singles, and five albums.

For a concert in Croatia, Mirić has a fee of 3,000 €.
